<p>"What?!" "That's disgusting..." "You're crazy!" These are common responses I get upon telling people that I have eaten canned salmon every day for the past three months. My decision to embark on this radical diet is threefold: It's economical. It's healthy. And it's different.</p>

<p>Financially speaking, canned salmon is a great way to save money. You can purchase a 14.75-ounce can for $2.50. In fact, every so often you can find a deal at Stop & Shop or Walgreens for as low as $1.99. Point being: canned salmon is going to make your wallet happy. As the co-founder of a bootstrapped startup who hadn't made a paycheck in years, this was necessary for me to keep our company afloat. Furthermore, unlike other foods like produce or fresh meat, canned salmon has a shelf life of five years. Waste, my friend, is a thing of the past.</p>

<p>There are also a myriad of health benefits associated with salmon consumption. Not only do you get omega-3 fatty acids that help brain functionality, but you also get essential vitamins and minerals like vitamin D and calcium. Moreover, as a weightlifter, I need about 140 grams of protein a day to maximize my efforts in the gym. One can of salmon contains 100 grams of protein, or roughly 70 percent of my daily requirement.</p>

<p>Lastly, eating anything for 100 days straight, let alone canned salmon, is unique. It gives me an off-the-wall talking point. Who the hell eats canned salmon? Nobody. Nobody eats canned salmon! So when diet or nutrition comes up in conversation, I'm always excited to see people's faces after I tell them about my regimen.</p> 

<p>I will conclude by saying that the Salmon Challenge isn't for everyone, especially the faint of heart. For obvious reasons, canned salmon doesn't taste as good as fresh salmon, and the repetition can break even the strongest of men & women. Don't say you weren't warned.</p>

<h3>General feedback I've received</h3>

<p>People usually warn me about mercury in fish. And while this is a valid concern, it's not entirely true. Salmon is at the bottom of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_in_fish#Levels_of_contamination">food chain</a>, meaning its mercury levels are minimal.</p>
