<p>This week's youth group session was different than normal. Attendance was low because of the holiday season. So to compensate, both of the co-ed groups joined forces. Instead of trying to teach both lesson plans in unison, the group leaders decided that a freeform discussion made more sense.</p>

<p>The floor was open for questions that we had regarding the Bible, faith or just life in general. One question that I found particularly interesting was, "How are you currently seeking God?" The girl who asked this question, Blair, teaches youth ministry at our church, and she cited her inability to separate day-to-day work from personal worship. I found this intriguing; not because I could relate to her circumstances directly, but rather because I could relate to them indirectly. I worked on Skimmin from home since we didn't have money to pay for office space, and there was a time period when I worked 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. (For the most part I averaged 12.) So in this regard, differentiating my personal life from my work life became difficult.</p>

<p>But in my opinion, the best discourse came towards the end, when we talked about John 3:16. With Christmas right around the corner, one of the group leaders thought it would be a good idea to go over the most recognizable verse in the Bible. "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Rather than reading the verse as a whole sentence, we dissected it phrase by phrase. 'For God' &bull; 'so loved' &bull; 'the world' &bull; 'he gave' &bull; 'one and only Son' &bull; 'whoever believes in him' &bull; 'shall not perish but have eternal life.'</p>

<p>For sake of brevity, I won't attempt to summarize our thoughts behind each phrase. Instead, I want to address one point that stood out. Melissa mentioned that she studied psychology in college and that the most painful experience a human can go through is the loss of a child. A child, quite literally, is a piece of you; someone you created from your own DNA. So when a child dies, it feels as though a significant piece of you is gone. That's why it's so interesting that God used his one and only Son's death as the premier demonstration of His Love for us. Going a step further (or back I should say), in Genesis it's revealed that we were created in God's image. So in a sense, God is telling us: "I understand your pain. Please trust me with all of your heart. Do not doubt my intentions. I have not forsaken you."</p> 

<p>My friend's parents are currently going through this grieving process. Their child, Robby, died in a tragic way ― to an extremely rare form of cancer ― at 20 years old. Please join me in praying for their family. They need biblical hope in this time of supreme sadness.</p>
