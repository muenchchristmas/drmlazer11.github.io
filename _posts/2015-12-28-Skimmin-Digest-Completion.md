<p>This menu was in my third iteration of Skimmin's interface. The purpose of this screen was to give our users a visual idea of which digests they had completed (i.e. read) and which ones still needed work.  

<p>The colors you're seeing (purple, blue, green, orange and red) correspond with the category of the digest's top story. So, in this example, today's digest's top story fell under the entertainment bucket (purple). 

<p>(Unfortunately I took a screenshot when all the digests were complete.)<p>
