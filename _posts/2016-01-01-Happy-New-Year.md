<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Thank You for the New Year.</p>

<p>Thank You for the people in my life who have showed me love & respect. And Thank You for helping me forgive the people who have showed me contempt & neglect.</p>

<p>Thank You for the food on my table, which provides the nutrients for my body.</p>

<p>Thank You for my good health, which enables me to experience all the Earth has to offer.</p>

<p>Thank You for the courage to stand up amid personal challenge and to be the support for others' adversity - no matter the weight.</p>

<p>I pray 2016 is a good year.</p>

<p>Jesus, amen.</p>
